**(Question 1)** *Look at the generated txt file including the ROC analysis
results. Which observer has achieved the best performance? Reader,
CAD, or Reader+CAD? What is your justification for this?*

In our case the CAD system had the best performance
1. R max FPF =  0.967.
2. R+CAD max FPF =  0.933.
3. CAD max FPF =  0.767.

The answer is quite simple: I'm not an expert radiologist and suffer from a cognitive bias that makes me weight my own judgement equally as the CAD judgement. Often I was taking the mean between CAD and my own probability which would probably increase the score of a professional but not of me as my own rating is absolute garbage.

**(Question 2)** *Looking at the sample result of the CAD system and
the ground truth in Figure 3, will CAD detection in the right lung be
considered as a true positive or a false positive in ROC analysis? Why?
Propose a modification to overcome this shortcoming. Elaborate your
answer.*




**(Question 3)** *As a general question far from this assignment, Com-
pare ROC and FROC analysis. Is there any situation in which FROC
provides us with some information that ROC does not?*


**(Question 4)** *What would you do to increase the power of the study?
Include more cases or more readers?*
