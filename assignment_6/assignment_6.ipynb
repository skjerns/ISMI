    "# Tasks\n",
    "We define 10 tasks in this assignment.\n",
    "The first 8 tasks are mandatory, the last 2 are optional.\n",
    "Although 10 tasks sound like a lot of work, you will see that (1) they are highly repetitive (meaning, you will do a lot of copy-paste across cells in the notebook), (2) you can reuse most of the things you did last week.\n",
    "Like we mentioned in the lecture this week, given the experience you have gained by defining datasets and training neural networks, training convolutional neural networks is just a natural step towards using a different architectures (and some additional tricks and tools).\n",
    "\n",
    "The task that we propose are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 1: build convolutional networks\n",
    "In this task, you will first define your training and validation set, then you will build the architecture of convolutional networks. We will propose an architecture that can be trained in a reasonable time using a CPU and the virtual machine that we provided (worst case scenario). In this setting, one epoch takes between 1 and 2 minutes, and we have observed that after 20 epochs we can already observe some interesting results. Using a GPU will of course speed up the experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 2: train convolutional networks\n",
    "In this task, you will train your first model using CIFAR10, apply the trained model to the test set, and submit the results to challenger. In order to define training functions and parameteres, you can reuse a lot of code developed last week.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 3: add dropout layer(s)\n",
    "In this task, you will modify the architecture of your network by adding dropout, which is implemented in Lasagne in the form of a layer. After that, you will repeat the training procedure and compare the results with the ones of the *plain* network.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 4: add batch normalization\n",
    "In this task, you will do something similar to task 3, but now adding batch normalization.\n",
    "You will repeat the exepriment and compare the performance with previous architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 5: try different initialization strategies\n",
    "We have seen that at least a couple of initilization strategies are known in the literature for (convolutional) neural networks.\n",
    "Several strategies are implemented in the Lasagne library.\n",
    "Try some of them and report the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 6: try different nonlinearities\n",
    "The same for nonlinearities, we have seen that ReLU is some kind of default choice for ConvNets, but other strategies exists. Do experiments, report the results and compare with previous approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 7: add L2 regularization\n",
    "Modify the loss function to use L2 regularization.\n",
    "Again, run experiments and report results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 8: add data augmentation\n",
    "Think of possible ways you can augment the (training) data.\n",
    "You can build a new (bigger) training set, or implement some kind of data augmentation *on-the-fly*, where some patches in the mini-batch are randomly selected and augmented with a (random) operation. Think of transofmrations that make sense in the context of classification of natural images.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 9 (optional): try different architecture\n",
    "You can try to improve the performance by modifying the architecture, using more layers, or wider layers (same number of layers but more filters, which means more parameters). Use all the tools you have investigated so far, the optimal combination of the options you have tried in previous tasks. The goal is to get high accuracy on the validation (and therefore on the test) set!\n",
    "This task is optional because depending on the depth of the network, a GPU may be necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 10 (optional): monitor the training procedure\n",
    "Finally, an optional task is to implement some tools to monitor the training procedure.\n",
    "Examples are the analysis of statistics of activations, or visualizing the filters learned.\n",
    "If done during training, visualizing filter will also nicely show how the network refines random parameters to come up with meaningful filters (especially in the first layer).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As done in previous assignments, in this notebook we provide some parts of code implemented.\n",
    "Some other parts are not implemented, but we define the variables that will be used in functions, to help you in the development of the assignment.\n",
    "Things that have been declared but not implemented are assigned a **None** value.\n",
    "That is the part that you have to implement.\n",
    "This means that every time you see **None**, it means that something is missing and you have to implement it."
